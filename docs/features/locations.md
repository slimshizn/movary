## Description

Locations (e.g. a cinema) can be set for a play.

Each user maintains a personal collection of available locations. The locations can be managed in the user settings at `/settings/account/locations`.
A location can be marked as a cinema.

When a users visibility is not set to private, others can see if a location is set for a play but not which exact location.

!!! Info

    This feature is optional and can be disabled. 
    
    Disabling keeps the current data, but hides all locations UI elements.
